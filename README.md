# Noubty2.0 - Clinical's Queues Management Application

This is a school project made in 2020 at Youcode - Youssoufia with the purpose of simulating a systematic and automatised management of clinical's waiting queues

## Frontend

the frontend part was built using Angular 8 and some libraries like Bootstrap.

to setup and run the front-end application, you need to run the backend application first (see Backend - API part) then run these commands:
 -  npm install (to install node modules)
 -  ng serve (to start the application)

## Backend - API

the API was built with Spring boot/data/security.

to run the API on server, you need to run MySql first on port 3360, and create a database with the name "noubty2.0" then open the app with eclipse and start it as a spring boot app
